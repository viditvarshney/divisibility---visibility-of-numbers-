L=[]
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%3==0 and i%7==0 and i%5!=0:
        L.append(str(i))
print(','.join(L))        
    
 # the purpose of using for loop is that    
# use for loop to give a range between 2000 and 3200 as per the question asks    
#then i use if loop to apply conditions 
#and after that i update the list , i use str(i) because at last we use .join() we will only works on string so we simply update my output with string and the use .join()
#we got output
